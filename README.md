# Smart Thermostat Project

This is the backend for my smart thermostat project.

## Why?
Well, first off, I wanted a smart thermostat that I fully controlled and wasn't hosted/controlled in the cloud.

Secondly, I'm using this project as an opportunity to create a php website+API+project from scratch, which
isn't something I've done before. I want to put into practice everything I've learned over the last 5 years 
in the industry and see how it goes. There's going to be lots of stuff in here that I've never had to build
(like an ORM or DB connector to name some), so I fully expect those to have bugs and probably some
vulnerabilities.

## Intended Features
* Docker File to install
* Things you'd expect from a smart thermostat
    * Use your imagination, I'm tired

## Contributing
I welcome PRs to this repo, but please don't just submit code. I want to know why you did something. If
you're fixing a bug or vulnerability or just updating my code, I want to know why what I did wasn't right,
so I can learn.
